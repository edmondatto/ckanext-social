## Requirements
This extension has been tested with the following versions of CKAN
and works well on these installations:
1. CKAN 2.7.0
2. CKAN 2.6.3
3. CKAN 2.5.4


## Installation

Installing this extension in your CKAN instance is as easy as installing any other CKAN extension.

Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example

`. /usr/local/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate`


#### Option 1: Install the extension using `python setup.py`

```commandline
$ git clone https://github.com/CodeForAfricaLabs/ckanext-social.git
$ cd ckanext-social
$ python setup.py install
```

Modify your configuration file (generally in `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`) and add `social` in the `ckan.plugins` property.

`ckan.plugins = social <OTHER_PLUGINS>`

#### Option 2: Install the extension using `pip install ckanext-social`
1. Install the ckanext-social Python package into your virtual environment:
```commandline
pip install ckanext-social
```


2. Add ``social`` to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   ``/etc/ckan/default/production.ini``).

3. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu:
```commandline
sudo service apache2 reload
```

### Development Installation
To install ckanext-social for development, activate your CKAN virtualenv and
run the following commands
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/edmondatto/ckanext-social.git
cd ckanext-social
python setup.py develop
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

### Tests

This sofware contains a set of test to detect errors and failures. You can run this tests by running the following command (this command will generate coverage reports):

```commandline
python setup.py nosetests
```
Note: The test.ini file contains a link to the CKAN test-core.ini file. You will need to change that link to the real path of the file in your system (generally /usr/local/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/test-core.ini).
